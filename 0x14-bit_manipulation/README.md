0x14.C - Bit manipulation

In this Project, we are learning to manipulate the C bitwise operators.
C program provides us with 6 operators for bit manipulation.
These operators are :

& bitwise AND
| bitwise OR
^ bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
<< left shift
>> right shift
~ One's complement (bitwise NOT) Note: this is unary.

These operators allow a programmer to get under the hood of the machine and manipulate bit individually.
There are a limitless applications for the bitwise operators.
